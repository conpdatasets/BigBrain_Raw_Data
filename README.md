# BigBrain 3D ROIs

## BigBrain

The BigBrain is the brain of a 65 years old man with no neurological or psychiatric
diseases in clinical records at time of death. The brain was embedded in parafin and
sectioned in 7404 coronal histological sections (20 microns), stained for cell bodies.
The BigBrain is the digitized reconstruction of the hi-res histological sections 
(20 microns isotropic).

## Dataset content

This dataset contains the post-mortem MRI aligned to the block faces and raw sections 
from the BigBrain published in the [BigBrain Project website](https://bigbrainproject.org).

The raw sections are available in tiff format. This MRI dataset is not in the aligned
histological space. Use the MRI in the [2015 release itself](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/bigbrain-datalad).
A few raw sections at 1-micron are available, unaligned as these have been rescanned, so not
aligned to the other raw images at 10-micron in the MINC and TIFF folders.


## Reference and more information

The BigBrain dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the
teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich)
and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute).
